description: Open source work used in What-Lang API
---

What-Lang API is not possible without the help of the open source community. We would like to thank the following open source projects that we use in our API:

- [Lingua](https://github.com/pemistahl/lingua-py) by [Peter M. Stahl](https://github.com/pemistahl). I have worked with Peter in the [Lingua Rust](https://github.com/pemistahl/lingua-rs) project, and What-Lang and our Slack translation app [X-late](https://x-late.x-tech.io) would not be possible without Lingua. We will continue to contribute to Lingua however we can.
