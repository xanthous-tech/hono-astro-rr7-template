### Why Hono?

Hono has a lot of modern features that make it better than plain express (which I used to use) for building backend for any application (web, native app, API SaaS):

- Runtime agnostic
- Zod validator middleware
- Hono client (no need for tRPC)
- Request Streaming
- OpenAPI documentation generation


### What is BullMQ?

BullMQ is a Redis-backed task queue and it provides a lot of important functionalities for building a scalable application at the start. At the age of AI, it is increasingly common to run long-running tasks in the background (LLM request chains), handle rate-limiting, running I/O intensive tasks in JS via horizontal scaling, and even interop with Python code. BullMQ unlocks all the possibilities.

### Why Remix + Astro?

Remix (React-router v7) is used as SSR frontend for the web-app. Having a server-side rendered application frontend is safer and easier to manage states. At the time of writing, React-router v7 just released and does not have strong static generation library / framework available even if the feature is provided, so Astro is added alongside of the project to handle static content. Landing page, blog and documentations are all handled by Astro.
